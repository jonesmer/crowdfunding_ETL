# crowdfunding_ETL
ETL group project created for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp in April 2024. Group members: Meredith Jones, Jonathan Gonzalez, and Celina Kamler.
Code includes cleaning and combining data sets on Crowdfunding campaign outcomes. After extracting, transforming, and loading the data, we imported the files into PGAdmin to run SQL queries. Troubleshooting support for GitHub collaboration was provided by instructor Kevin Lee.
